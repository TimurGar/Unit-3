### Context of the product
My dad has a diabity type-1 therefore he has an increased amount of sugar in the blood. To decrease the amount of sugar you need to exercise(Ex: running). 
Decreased amount of sugar means less insulin has to be injected therefore your liver stays more healthy and so a better quality of life. To keep track of the blood sugar my dad exercises a lot, he at least once a day.
He needs to keep track of his activities and for now he uses notices of the smartphone which takes a lot of time to organise and he constantly afraid to lose his data.
My dad would like to have a program that would make it very easy to add and view the activities that he does. My dad asked me to create an app that would solve his problems with keeping his activities.
